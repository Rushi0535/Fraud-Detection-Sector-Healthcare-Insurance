# Fraud Detection in Healthcare Insurance

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities in healthcare insurance using various machine learning techniques. The process involves loading and exploring datasets, cleaning and preprocessing the data, conducting exploratory data analysis, engineering features, building and evaluating machine learning models, and finally selecting the best model for fraud detection.

## Project Objectives
Provider fraud is one of the biggest problems facing Medicare. According to the government, the total Medicare spending has increased exponentially due to fraud in Medicare claims. Healthcare fraud is an organized crime involving providers, physicians, and beneficiaries acting together to make fraudulent claims.

Rigorous analysis of Medicare data has identified many physicians who indulge in fraud by using ambiguous diagnosis codes to adopt the costliest procedures and drugs. Insurance companies are the most vulnerable institutions impacted by these bad practices. Consequently, insurance companies have increased their premiums, making healthcare more costly.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to predict potentially fraudulent providers based on their claims, studying patterns in their claims to understand and predict future behaviors.

## Introduction to the Dataset
The dataset includes Inpatient claims, Outpatient claims, and Beneficiary details for each provider:
- **Inpatient Data:** Claims filed for admitted patients.
- **Outpatient Data:** Claims filed for non-admitted patients.
- **Beneficiary Details Data:** KYC details such as health conditions and region.

## Structure
### Importing Libraries
- Essential libraries for data manipulation, numerical operations, and visualization.

### Loading Data
- Load datasets from CSV files.

### Initial Data Exploration
- Inspect dataset dimensions, column names, data types, and initial rows.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and convert data types.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize distributions of important features and identify patterns.

### Feature Engineering
- Enhance model performance by creating new features.

### Building and Evaluating Models
- Train models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Model Tuning and Validation
- Perform hyperparameter tuning and validate using cross-validation.

### Final Model Selection and Testing
- Select and test the best-performing model on unseen data.

### Conclusion and Insights
- This project provides a comprehensive approach to detecting fraud in healthcare insurance using machine learning. By following the structured process outlined in the notebook, you can understand and apply various techniques to identify fraudulent activities in the dataset.
